<h2><font face="ANURATI" COLOR="GOLD"><center>HISTORY OF ANANDA COLLEGE.</center></font></h2>
<P align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="cyan">The arrival of American Theosophist, Col. Henry Steel Olcott and Madam Blavatsky in Galle on 17th May 1880 and the establishment of 
 Buddhist Theosophical Society (BTS) is synonymous with the Buddhist revival in Sri Lanka 
 (then Ceylon). Having read a copy of Panadura Vadaya (a debate held in Ceylon between Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thero and French born Catholic Priest,
 Fr. Legg), Col. Olcott saw the sad plight of majority Buddhists due to suppression in the hands of Christian Missionaries and ruling Colonial Masters.
 <br>
 <br>
 The establishment of BTS was pioneered by patriots like Anagarika Dharmapala, Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, Valisinghe Harischandra and Ven. Hikkaduwe 
 Sri Sumangala Thera. Their primary task was to set up English schools for majority Buddhists who were not endowed with a good English education. The fruits 
 of the hard work done by those fearless leaders was amply manifested when on 1st November 1886 an English Buddhist School was opened at No. 54, Maliban Street [a large House with 5 rooms], Pettah with only 37 students.
 Mr. C. W. Leadbeater was its Principal and the staff consisted of 7 teachers. The average attendance in the first 6 months was only 111, according to a report by Mr. W. Blair, Inspector of Schools. From No. 54, Maliban 
 Street, Pettah, it was shifted to no. 19, Prince Street, Pettah in August, 1889, before Ananda found its permanent niche at Maradana in 1895. By this time the student population had risen to over 130. The Head Master and 
 the Boarders resided in the upper floor. Mr. A. E. Bultjens, a graduate from Cambridge University was in the staff. The formal registration in order to be identified as “The daily Buddhist English Academy“ was realized in
 March, 1889 and it coincided with the arrival of two new staff members, namely, Mr. Oliver James & Mr. Bath from Madras , India. History was created when young J. P. R. Weerasuriya Silva from this Academy was successful at 
 the Cambridge Junior Examination. The site at Paranavadiya in Maradana, was bought for a sum of Rs.35,000/=, lent by the BTS in India and that is where Ananda stands today. This loan was repaid from the proceeds of Golden 
 Jubilee Celebrations held in 1936 during Principal, P. de. S Kularatne’s time, a period widely accepted as the Golden Era of Ananda.
